I am currently a postdoctoral research assistant working with [Chris Heunen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cheunen/) and [Tobias Grosser](https://grosser.science/) on the intersection of programming languages, compilation, and quantum computing. I have just submitted my thesis for a PhD at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jv258/).

## About Me

I am generally interested at the moment in all things related to
programming languages and type systems, and tools for working with
these. In my PhD, I developed two variants of the type theory Catt, a
type theory which models globular weak infinity categories. These
variants had added definitional equality allowing them to model
semistrict infinity categories. During this I generated an interpreter
for these languages, and formalised a substantial portion of their
metatheory in Agda.

I also enjoy formalising things in Agda, programming in rust, and am a
user of Emacs and the NixOS Linux distribution. My other interests
include ice skating/ice hockey and playing cello in orchestras.

## Thesis
My thesis "A type-theoretic approach to semistrict higher categories", was submitted on 18th April 2024 ([pdf](pub/thesis.pdf), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17068))
