I am studying at the University of Cambridge after completing the first year of my PhD at the University of Birmingham. I am
working under the supervision of [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jv258/).

## About Me

My main interests at the moment are type theory, including Homotopy Type Theory, and its applications to higher category theory. I am currently looking at
various definitions of globular higher categories and am thinking
about semi-strictness problems and types of composition.

Before starting my PhD I completed a 4-year integrated masters program
in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
During this time I took courses including Category Theory (including
theory of monoidal categories), Algebraic Topology, Homological
Algebra, Logic, ZFC Set Theory, and Representation Theory.

I also enjoy formalising things in Agda and and am a user of Emacs and the NixOS Linux
distribution.

## Thesis
My thesis "A type-theoretic approach to semistrict higher categories", was submitted on 18th April 2024 ([pdf](pub/thesis.pdf))
