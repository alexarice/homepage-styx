I have just transferred to the University of Cambridge after completing the first year of my PhD at the University of Birmingham. I am
working under the supervision of [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jv258/).

## About Me

My main interests at the moment are category theory, especially higher
category theory, and Homotopy Type Theory. I am currently looking at
various definitions of globular higher categories and am thinking
about semi-strictness problems and types of composition.

Before starting my PhD I completed a 4-year integrated masters program
in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
During this time I took courses including Category Theory (including
theory of monoidal categories), Algebraic Topology, Homological
Algebra, Logic, ZFC Set Theory, and Representation Theory.

I also enjoy playing with functional programming languages such as
Haskell or Agda and am a user of Emacs and the Nixos Linux
distribution.
